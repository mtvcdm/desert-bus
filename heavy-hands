If I turn my eyes
From these cold blue skies
Won’t stay my worry
Won’t calm or quell

I can say my piece
I can barter my tale
Won’t ease my burden
But I might as well

There’s a heavy hand
Laid across this land
And it steers my journey
And it guides my pen

Press on, head high
‘Til the ink has run dry
‘Cause my story ain’t like
To wind home again


Well, I’ll beat my drum
‘Til my last day come
Or the mountain meets the sea

Yeah, the earth will shake
But the boughs she break
Won’t put no fear in me

‘Cause I see a land on high
So I pen my final line

Sky will shimmer and sun will shine
Where the water tastes like wine

Well, I’ve wandered ‘round
And there’s a code I found
Says a gentle manner
And a righteous way

This pair you’ll need
If you follow this creed
She’ll see you through
Until the judgement day

But there ain’t no law
Under tooth and claw
In the nest of vipers
Or the lion’s den

You can holler and wail
‘Til the echo goes stale 
Ain’t way nor manner
Gonna save you then

But I’ll beat my drum
‘Til my last day come
Or the mountain meets the sea

Yeah, the earth will shake
But the boughs she break
Won’t put no fear in me

‘Cause I see a land on high
So I pen my final line

Well, stories end and I’m closin’ mine
Where the water tastes like wine

So when the waters still
And you feel that thrill
For the open trail
Has slipped away

When the words won’t flow
When your fingers run slow
And the song you carry
Goes dull and gray.

Well, there’s a place I seen
Where the soul burns clean
And the verse it’s singin’
Rings pure and true

So cry no more
You just open that door
These shores of plenty
Gonna welcome you

And I beat my drum
‘Til my last day come
Or the mountain meets the sea

Yeah, the earth will shake
But the boughs she break
Won’t put no fear in me

‘Cause I see a land on high
So I pen my final line

I’ve said my fill and I’m feelin’ fine
Where the water tastes like wine
